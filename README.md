# 0x15 - Simple Shell
## Description

In the Simple Shell project we were tasked with creating a simple UNIX command interpreter. The program must copy the exact output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the same output. The only difference is when printing an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].


### Instructions
- How to compile the program: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh.
